# Token Transfer Options

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **NFC Handshake**: Working perfectly (confirmed in logs)
- ‚úÖ **BLE Server**: Starts successfully on receiver
- ‚ùå **BLE Advertising**: Not supported on older test device
- ‚è≥ **Transfer Testing**: Blocked by empty wallet

## Option 1: BLE Transfer (Fast, Limited Device Support)
**Speed**: Very fast (~1-2 seconds for any size)
**Device Requirements**: 
- Android devices with BLE advertising support
- Usually flagship phones from 2018+
- Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S series, OnePlus, etc.

**User Experience**: Perfect single-tap
1. Tap phones ‚Üí Immediate BLE connection ‚Üí Transfer complete

**Limitations**: 
- Not supported on older/budget Android devices
- Some manufacturers disable BLE advertising

---

## Option 2: Direct NFC Transfer (Slower, Universal)
**Speed**: Size-dependent
- 50KB token: ~10-15 seconds
- 100KB token: ~20-30 seconds  
- 250KB token: ~60-90 seconds
- 500KB token: ~2-3 minutes

**Device Requirements**: 
- Any Android device with NFC (universal)
- Works on all phones from 2012+

**User Experience**: Single-tap, keep phones together
1. Tap phones ‚Üí Keep together during transfer ‚Üí Complete

**Advantages**:
- Works on any NFC device
- No BLE dependency
- Reliable and consistent

---

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)
**Strategy**: Try BLE first, fallback to NFC
- Devices with BLE: Fast transfer
- Older devices: Reliable NFC transfer
- User gets best experience for their hardware

**Implementation**:
1. Receiver advertises both NFC HCE + BLE
2. Sender tries BLE scan first (2-3 seconds)
3. If BLE fails ‚Üí automatic NFC direct transfer
4. User sees progress for current method

## Recommendation for Production

**Use Option 3 (Hybrid)** for best user experience:
- Modern phones: Lightning fast BLE
- Older phones: Reliable NFC fallback
- Universal compatibility
- Single codebase handles both

## Current Implementation
- ‚úÖ Option 1 (BLE) is implemented
- üîÑ Adding demo tokens with different sizes
- üìã Option 2 (Direct NFC) ready to implement as fallback
